      <description>Welcome Welcome to my new website! This website uses the Hugo static site builder. All pages and posts are exported from Org-mode files using ox-hugo. The theme is hugo-theme-console by Marcin Mierzejewski.
Since the page is written entirely in structured org-mode files using markdown, it should be much easier to maintain.</description>
